The goal of this repo is to provide and maintain an archived, legacy and
working Qucsator reference implementation.

Patches will be accepted (as time permits) given they fix obvious bugs or build
issues. To speed up the process, please provide necessary information about the
system. Please share some kind of test or prodecure that demonstrates that a
patch has the desired effect and that there are no side effects. Normally a
simplistic Qucsator input file will do as a test. Qucs produces such files in
~/.qucs/netlist.txt.

New feature requests and new features should be targeted to maintained forks
(such as Qucsator_rf) or to Qucsator replacements (such as Gnucsator). See also
Qucs/ROADMAP.
